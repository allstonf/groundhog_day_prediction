___Introduction___

The legend goes that:

- if Phil, a 130 year old groundhog,  sees his shadow on February 2 (Groundhog Day), there will be an extended winter for the next six weeks.

- if he doesn't see his shadow, that means an early spring is on the way.

We evaluated Phil's predictive performance over time and found that he is marginally better than a random classifier.

___Conclusion___

An interesting insight is that when compared to a classifier that randomly predicts the season change, Phil performs marginally better than the classifier by about 2%.

However, when compared to a classifier that always predicts an extended winter, Phils performs just as well as the classifier.

But, actually Phil is right 100% of the time, according to the Groundhog Clubâ€™s Inner Circle.

The Inner Circle is a group of local dignitaries responsible for carrying on the tradition of Groundhog Day every year. 

They're the ones who are not only responsible for planning the events every year, but they're also responsible for the feeding and care of Phil himself!
